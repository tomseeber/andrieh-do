Every time I try do do the magical challenge, I have to do a whole bunch of magic that is not fucking planned.  Today, it was client work with Ogun and boy oh boy did I hear from him.  He was more angry with the client, but did what I asked of him because it was me.  This is problematic in that I am trying to rebuild my shit but I did take off some hours from work to deal with the physical ritual of the magical work.  I nearly got possessed.  Ok for some time, I did get possessed.

## Fire is Dope, but difficult.
So I was behind on this work for the client.  Fire as a magical praxis is totally enliving, if you have enough to take it.   So you can punch above your weight class with fire magic, and you can really replenish your Chi through fire magic work, BUT you have to have enough left in the system to actually control the fire.  When there is not enough focus because of the lack of energy, fire magic becomes really a liability.

In most clasical forms of Qigong, most of the techniques are gentle and often involve moving energy around.  If your energy system is really fried or not used to this,  moving fire throughout your energy system could actually cause damage.  A few like the microcosmic orbit, are considered more firey and Yang.  These are typically the more advanced techniques.  You can go alot further then a microcosmic orbit.  These techniques usually are not taugh to anyone for YEARS, because people will get all ignite with the fire energies or prana energies and just burn themselves up.  

Every increase in fire ability, also means you have to gain greater control over various flavors of chi ( and usually hotter less controlable chi).  Its like you have to be double better at meditation work in applied sittings.

In any case, the fire praxis requires a little more attention and focus but comes with big payoffs.  I probably given the grieving process, could not actually do a fire magic ritual till 7+ days after starting serious focus building and gigong.   That was all to get my ass back into somewhat ok shape to handle it.

BTW, Ogun loves the fire... This ritual was all fire.  After the complaints settled down, mostly about the client making this too dificult, he got to work.   The trick is, if you have enough to control the fire, you can get alot back to as it multiplies the energy in your system.

I might have felt eh before the ritual, but now.. BAM.  Mind you still greiving, but I have alot of energy to do that. 
Anyway, I feel like 2 spirit workings, and I have to do a 3rd, ITS that kind of day, is a good enough to substitute for Qigong today.  I will however do the meditaiton.
