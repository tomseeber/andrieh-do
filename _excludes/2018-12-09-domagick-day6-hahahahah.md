## The Art of War
So I posted this on my facebook page yesterday:

>I match witchcraft of the mouth ( mostly false gossip intended to harm) with actual witchcraft, and I am pretty good at that actual magic stuff. Just be a better person, if you have a problem with me, let's talk over coffee or something. I am generally reasonable even if I am the wronged party, and pretty forgiving. This is true not just for me, we can make things better for each other by stopping others who are doing this and just telling them.. Knock it off.
So moving

Not a few hours letter I felt a little impotent annoyance.
After 3 independant readings, from people who did not know what really was going on ... all three strongly said the same thing, someone tried ( and failed to "curse" me).

All I can say to that is 
	**Hahaahahahahhahaahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha**

Good luck, you'll need it.  Nice to be right about things.

Moving on.
