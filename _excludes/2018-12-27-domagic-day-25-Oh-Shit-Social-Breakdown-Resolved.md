So a big drain on the positive energy of our household was removed.  We had let some people stay to try to get their life together.   They are gone.

They honestly created problems and did so in passive aggressive ways from breaking my space down ( and then playing the victim card after repeated requests to please don't do that), refusing to energy cleanse themselves, or take any personal responsibility.  Many times they would pass it off like, oh its not us, its the disease but this is just gaslighting and they would ramp that fear and anxiety up in themselves to cause problems throughout the house.  I am very willing to help people but not people who won't help themselves.   When you push boundaries to cause other people pain, you can't really claim its just the mental illness sorry, not sorry.  Then they did this over text and honestly the most insulting way possible. 

That is not how you gain control over your own life without major problems.

I believe this is a direct result of the ![Angelic purification ritual]() based to purify and expel the negative energies in the house ( part of they were causing, part of it was our own issues, part of it was the reaction to those issues).
