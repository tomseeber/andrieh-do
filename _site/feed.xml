&lt;p&gt;So to deal with the idea of the conceptualization of the anxiety disorder of others as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic.html&quot;&gt;greater spiritual evil&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to do a more poweful angelic summoning of seven planetary angels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saturn    =  Cassiel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jupiter   =   Tzadikiel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mars  =   Samael&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sun   =  Michael&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Venus =  Haniel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mercury =  Raphiel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moon =  Gabriel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a longer ritual and involves blessing each set of herbs and candles with the planetary intelligence, and then elevating like a journey to the planetary archanglel after starting with a planetary gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LBRP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planetary gateway opening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planetary Inteligence ( drawn on candle) and repeated drawn over herbs per planet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planetary archangel per planet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After 7 planetary archangels are present, call Metatron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the herbs were blessed, and the candles tied to the evoked angel.   Part of the herbs were used to make a floor wash, part was used to make mojo bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done with drawings on the floor, to make the floor talismanic with the intention to clear all the negativity out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house was completely rocking and I saw respectible  changes in behavior right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powerful changes actually. Moving forward on this.  Two rooms of people who were staying with us were actually pretty horrible.  There were lots of problems with them from crossing boundaries, to causing problems purposely. No they didn’t pay rent and we were trying to pay it forward. Completely horrible. New rule, Ill pay it forward from the outside of my house on.  The Archangel Michel got really pissed about how toxic the energy was and cleared it out.  Actually I cried while doing the summoning.  These parties were gone for Xmas.
We asperged the house after boiling blessed herbs together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again major positive behavior changes in .   Good times.  The actual ritual was like 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple huge negatives.   It has taken me an immense bit of time to undo and work through the negativity around me that I could see after starting to do the qigong.  This was time I needed to work on my course work at Trilogy for the computer science classes.  I also because of the collective effect of the holiday + negativity clearing have been eating wrongly again.  Yes things are getting better, but its taken a toil to move the dial with the Qigong and purifications.   I have to get a handle on all that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 20 Microcosmic Orbit and Testing</title><link href="/december-2018/2018/12/22/domagick-day-20-Switched-to-Microcosmic-orbit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 20 Microcosmic Orbit and Testing" /><published>2018-12-22T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-22T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>/december-2018/2018/12/22/domagick-day-20-Switched-to-Microcosmic-orbit</id><content type="html" xml:base="/december-2018/2018/12/22/domagick-day-20-Switched-to-Microcosmic-orbit.html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an insanely busy day.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;go-hard-or-go-home&quot;&gt;Go Hard or Go home.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on line with this do magick challenge, I performed a purification ritual, a much larger Faery Purification ritual with the goal of a creating a greater talisman resonate with a specific type of faery entity.   I will not say much more about this talisman but will say it took me a good 5-6 hours and that was in a DEEP shamanic state, I mean deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, no pictures my friends.  No pictures of my talismans.  I got the talisman done, but its not quite as pretty yet and I need to build a makeshift forge to do this. This talisman is directly related to the post &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic.html&quot;&gt;fighting the anxiety demon around me&lt;/a&gt;.  It is purposely attuned to help fight that, and some other issues of a similar to spiritual strenghtening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details, nope.  Yes they do more then that, but nope nope nope I am not saying.  6 hours of work, not trivial spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticeable effects, on certain targets.  Yep…  They are shy spirits, cant say more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 19 Qigong Qigong and Angels</title><link href="/december-2018/2018/12/21/domagick-day-19-its-a-blur.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 19 Qigong Qigong and Angels" /><published>2018-12-21T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-21T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>/december-2018/2018/12/21/domagick-day-19-its-a-blur</id><content type="html" xml:base="/december-2018/2018/12/21/domagick-day-19-its-a-blur.html">&lt;p&gt;So on day 19,   I did some Michael and Haniel work respectively  ( Venus and the Sun) to start refocusing and detailing, and turning things around.  So this was a continuation of the expression of conceptualizing some of the issues as external entities from &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/18/domagick-day-18-Every-Day-1-Step.html&quot;&gt;previous days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by blessing some every day items, and doing some some Qigong to build energy before doing anything else.  Then rolled into the angel work on the points, carving out some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this combination definitely seemed to work although there was some push back it on some of this, but there was most certainly progress that was visual and tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much so, very much so.   Some reactions, some pushback, but tangible progress.   The Qigong, helps to ground and build earthy based Qi before doing the more cerebral energy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this conception of some of the issues as a foreign malefic agent gives me some tools that are working to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So on day 19, I did some Michael and Haniel work respectively ( Venus and the Sun) to start refocusing and detailing, and turning things around.

&lt;p&gt;Tested Qigong with my student and did a good 30 minutes of macrocosmic orbit.   One of the gifts I recieved was a buddha board.  It turns out this is a unbelievable talisman for spirit work in general, and just kinda cool.    The buddha board actual uses clear water and disappears as you write.   So it has a temporary ink scroll effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac and I summoned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Xi-Wang-Mu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Xi-Wang-Mu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;xi-wang-mu-西王母&quot;&gt;Xi Wang Mu 西王母&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;queen-mother-of-the-west&quot;&gt;Queen Mother of the West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;devourer-of-men&quot;&gt;Devourer of Men&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;granter-of-life&quot;&gt;Granter of Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;teacher-of-the-immortals&quot;&gt;Teacher of the Immortals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a spirit that was bothering me to make contact because Zac had previously made contact but it just didn’t go right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ritual was actually one of the few non-purification rituals I  have done in the last 20 days, although arguably it was empowering.  This spirit is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ritual was almost purely Shamanic aka just fucking do it, not much ritual, but there were some ritual components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first we sanctified the Buddha Board and the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty sure I understood the spirit from the initial contact the spirit had made with me.  Now, I had very few details about the spirit outside of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into a shamanic trance and started drawing on the board.  The board only lasts a minute, so its phenomenal automatic drawing/writing tool for trance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I draw.  Foxes, mountains, even the description as a truly beautiful woman was all right on the money.   I described a spirit that has the keys to life and death and is somewhat detached and humorous about that.   Then started relaying message through the board ( writing them down) and they would disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac did divinations.   Everything was very consistent with historical information of the older versions of Xi Wang Mu, not the newer salvationist narratives.  Then shit got personal, and we tried to do a working directly with channeled energies from the spirit and into the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this seemed to become a moving spell like a animation as I was drawing it, because the board itself fades, it allows for a sort of moving sigil, or series of temporary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very cool experience and meets a lot of where I need to be working right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Portable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimalist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Essentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now honestly the board disappears too quickly for normal sigil work, or at least you’d have to repetitively draw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some issues where the medium ( ahem Zac) interrupted in the spell work.   SO, I had to teach my bro some things about that style of work :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that said,  It was actually a very life affirming ritual ( she has access to the peaches that the immortals eat to become Taoist immortals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really the talisman work her was to sanctify the buddha board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 18 - Every Day 1 Step</title><link href="/december-2018/2018/12/20/domagick-day-18-Every-Day-1-Step.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 18 - Every Day 1 Step" /><published>2018-12-20T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-20T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>/december-2018/2018/12/20/domagick-day-18-Every-Day-1-Step</id><content type="html" xml:base="/december-2018/2018/12/20/domagick-day-18-Every-Day-1-Step.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTB7Vt7oA8oKr_rmam0kpD2d5V0YjSXubk3I2TVE94I9Ligg-Qs&quot; alt=&quot;fish organizing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;one-change-per-day&quot;&gt;One Change per day.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my longer &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/18/Changing-the-dynamic.html&quot;&gt;post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;,  I realized too, that I can’t just do Qigong outside where I am staying and it will get better.  This does not fix any of the causes.  I realize pretty outright, that any changes I might try to make will be seriously contested.  Re-framing the overwhelming anxiety as a malevolent and entropic force, allows me to direct my anger at that force, not the people.  This is a major shift in conceptualizing the problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully expect to get outright resistance, passive resistance, broken stuff and more emotional whiplash as I push forward, but conceptualizing the force in this way allows me to show compassion towards the people and yet stand my ground.  I know this will be difficult, but conceptualizing the people as under the influence of a powerful being, lets me absolve some of the inter personal issues involved and take magical action against that being and not the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost always the track you have to take, if you are doing healing magic with anyone who identifies with the disease egregore but has tried to get healing.  Once you loose the detachment, loose the ability to conceptualize the disease or spirit as separate from the person, you are really actually losing the fight to make anything better in the situation.   Step back, get outside help for perspective.  Stupid fae spirits had to do that for me again.. hahah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a sleight of mind, you bet your ass it is.&lt;/strong&gt;   Sometimes a useful remapping is better then the truth which is largely a lie too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I did make a request to change some components of the environment, I believe the request will help all parties.  I do not know if the request which was made in a very business yet positive way will go over well.  Remember, social unpredictability is part of the “conceptualization” of the powers of the spiritual  malignant opponent.  Unpredictability is a means to take power over the social reality, and it further creates a cycle of anxiety.   I would expect a fair amount of resistance and I have some alternative solutions if it becomes an issue, but I will be taking the one step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thats the lesson.
Other peoples inner demons and pain will infect you and consume you, manifesting in totally different ways once they get inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to remember, you can only take and secure one step at a time when making things better.   Not all of those steps will be doable in the time frame you would like.  People will resist and fight for the status quo, sometimes with great vigilance.  Be stronger, more patience and kinder then the resistance of the pain.  Can’t do something one way, do it another.  Can’t change the physical reality because of the status quo, call on spirits to help clear some of the pain.  Try again.  Repeat.  Analysis.  Find the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah,  I did the Qigong today, again outside ( over by my work) but I did get some coffee after.
Haha, Also did the object concentration ( later at night).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 17 - Insight to Changes, Changing the Dynamic</title><link href="/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 17 - Insight to Changes, Changing the Dynamic" /><published>2018-12-19T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic</id><content type="html" xml:base="/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/True_Grit_1725x810-PAN_19746.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;grit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;forcing-it-to-change&quot;&gt;Forcing it to Change.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after yesterdays big old &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/18/Jettison-and-cut.html&quot;&gt;wtf post&lt;/a&gt;, I pretty well decided in meditation to make some small changes.  I suggested that yesterday, but as I thought about it, there were even more simple changes I could make.  For instance, &lt;em&gt;why the fuck am I doing Qigong in a place basically toxic&lt;/em&gt;.  I am not backing away from that conclusion.  An LBRP is not enough, did I forget all the shit I do, apparently I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, go to the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UpGbUtb-CxA/VzJHsxIBFHI/AAAAAAAAs_M/P8JwaWZJIuI8ykQ4ASlFZHFxGbnY-FyvQCHM/s1600/forest-night-amazing-wallpapers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;forest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok this is not the forest, but I went out to a consecrated forest at night.  It was supremely sublime and pretty.   Cold and next to a waterfall which is the perfect fucking answer to anxiety energy toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is in Chi terms is a  Yang concentration in overdrive in channels that should not be so overstimulated.   That in returns FUCKS the rest of the body energy system, cause its got to draw from somewhere.      So fuck it….  Cold Air at night is like the total opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I outright did some other things to really BOOST my qigong.   First, I called to Gran Bwa after Legba.  Then in my own way, I called the night spirits around me.  Yes the winter monster night spirits ( its not all that bad seriously. I did not have to ask for help but they did.   For the first time in a long time,  I felt truly a sense of joy and peace after doing the Qigong.   I felt the night spirits and the river spirits, and they pulled a-lot of shit out.   Plus that, it was not human energy I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is a human energy construct.  Animals over time might have anxiety, but mostly its fear and it is not the same.   They recover from anxiety a lot faster because they do not think about the state of their anxiety which makes it amp up the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, I was very aware of the sensation of anxiety at a Christmas Dinner.  This is not a situation I should have had that anxiety.  I know these people well.  Granted, I do not really like some of them, but it should not be anxiety producing.  Usually it is not, and that is not me.  I am currently around people that have both social anxiety and general anxiety disorder. People with an anxiety disorder, no offense if you have it (and I wish for healing if you do), do not act in socially predicable ways.  In fact, you never quite now what will produce a major meltdown.  If this is what you are around most of the time, you start looking at others and start thinking will this provoke a adverse reaction?  Which starts a bigger and downward spiral of anxiety in you.  Even with shielding, and re-framing, being around this too much creates anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we should correctly label that anxiety as a malignant and entropic entity.  An entity itself, that does not wish to negotiate as it represents the worst instincts and brings us to our most reptilian self.  Noticing I am not saying the people who suffer from this terrible affliction are malignant.  While fear is redeemable ( to survive), anxiety is false fear that only serves to propagate itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, my friends, stalkers (hahah), and readers is a very shaman thing to do.  Once you have conceptualized something this far,  you can start to fight it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-simple-things-i-am-going-to-do-from-here-in-the-start-of-the-fight&quot;&gt;The simple things I am going to do from here, in the start of the fight.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do Qigong in the goddamn forest unless it is too cold, try to do it earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever possible go to the spirits, for a purer contact until a formal and separate temple can be re-established (or at least a private space with strong aka locked boundaries)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid un-needed contact with non-family members that have these sorts of issues.   Do not let this be normalized in your head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find clubs ( obviously if you are reading, not my current Toastmasters group ) or other groups that clearly do not normalize the state of hyper anxiety.  While I can, I am seriously thinking of joining the Masons for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid any groups or collectives that normalize the acceptance of the victim mentality.  ( its ok to be hurting, its not ok to accept that you cant do anything about this shit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I would at this stage whip up something in my private space, but the anxiety issues others have brought forth have seriously and continuously challenged my dominion over some spaces.  Anxiety is a tricky beast too.  People will try to “help” you who have the issues, only to violate boundaries set down and then turn back as the victim, and hyper anxiety state when they beat themselves up over someone pushing back on the boundary. Remember, defined as a malignant entropic being, its number 1 goal is to cause and create more anxiety in the host as well as everyone around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of the anxiety pathogen, is to create the illusion you have no real volition or control over your life, so of course, crossing boundaries to challenge the dominion over a stated space, is an attempt by the entity itself to destroy volition of someone else so it can spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not agree with conceptualizing this as a spirit, but it is at least a thought form that pings each other person.  In fact, I can see it spread and cause pain like waves in those around me.   If a thing can be conceptualized as a spirit, it can be exorcised or fought as a spirit.  Sometimes, giving form and conceptualization to something makes it stronger.   In this case, if you think about it, anxiety thrives by not be called out in this fashion.   Likewise, people will usually not admit they can DO things to stop this shit and will not let you challenge the anxiety as it has become a defining aspect of their identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally, its what I have been doing for the last 19 days of the challenge.   Qigong, banishing, thinking, repeat to get over the rawness after my teacher died and challenge those reactions. Usually, I would be more resilient. I see now, I may have to employ more aggressive tactics in a spiritual throw-down.   I have some .. “private” techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better to fight, then the alternative which is simply more anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

Jettison.  The message from the universe.  The toastmaster word of the day.  Apropos exact message from the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jettison 
	to throw away or get rid of something that is not wanted or needed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 days of emotional turmoil basically caused by other people and my reaction to their reactions. I am partially to blame and I’ll own it.  Some of my decisions led to the place I am at.  Sometimes, it can’t get better till you clear out the poison and just admit, you fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be really blunt with the Qigong and other stuff I am doing, I can see my living conditions and lifestyle is not at all emotionally safe. Quite the opposite. I don’t have a safe space, and have stopped trusting my support network. I turn around and if I don’t get it from one angle I am getting it from another from the people around me.  Again, as the Shiva work all suggested, its social poisons dragging a lot of me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this, is kinda just too many people living in the same area,  some of it is not. There is simply a lot of emotions, that are not expressible even in what should be my space.  Its all really killing me one encounter at a time, and somedays I feel like I am losing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy work is keeping that from happening, and allowing me to &lt;strong&gt;detach as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. What the energy work is revealing, is the reality so I can do something about it.  Theres not much renewing going on, but at least I am getting some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have to find and seek out the wins, allow the garbage to dissolve in the eye of Shiva, and keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, the drama continued from yesterday and when I did what was actually asked of me by others, I made it worse because they didn’t really mean it and then I had already done what was asked.   It made things worse of course. Vaguepost aside, and sorry about that…  I need to get back to trusting my intuition and being even more stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Toastmasters too, I was further reminded some shit needs to change.  I  literally told people I was going to bring plates and did it in the google sheets.  Someone brought plates and stuff and they wanted just to make sure it was done.  I was done with that group, right there.   Tired of being disrespected. Really tired.  Jettison is the word of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I feel like more and more, I probably after the death of my family member, I am in that realm of highly functioning depressed.  I am not sure it is really chemical, but it feels like every day, I have to deal with something insanely emotionally charged, that is extraordinarily draining to me. I cant shake it or get the space to shake it.   Like I said, physically speaking, my living situation is not emotionally safe for me. I kinda only have myself to blame for that based on a host of decisions, and because of that I cant get my footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can admit today, after the meditation and work that truth about the emotional insecurity.  Before I was in denial.  Denial is not really a place where you can make change.  At least now, I can start using Qigong and reframing to toughen myself up, and reframe and rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is to say, what do I do about it?   Right now, I have some pretty good ideas.  Energy is the problem but I am going to have some time without work which means I can do larger rituals.   The first thing I will do is a much bigger and aggressive uncrossing with the archangel Micheal. There is other spirits I can work with and will try some of that too. Then keep doing the Qigong and a 1080 fire homa ( probably more of a bonfire) with Shiva… again truly forcing the negative energy to alchemize one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, yes I did the Qigong today and LBRP, but I did it in my office at work.  Honestly, right now, despite all the bullshit at work, it feels more emotionally safe.  I did meditatively walk as well, and did 20 minutes of object concentration.  That’s why I can write about it, with some honestly and detachment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">sh Jettison. The message from the universe.

Got to ride a train ( el ) which I did the sitting meditation.  I did the Qigong and angel work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, some people had moved stuff on me, and I got real angry.  Feeling of trapped and no respect.  There is alot of frustration over this, I know the real real reason was that I felt like I had no control.  Its the sensation of the walls closing in, and people giving you no space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been a rough couple days with this.  One fight, then another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I really miss the meditative train rides.  Writing the blog posts a day or later removes much of the viciousness of the experience, so it less raw after a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sure sign, the banishing and Qigong is working as is the banishing rituals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Took 2 long walks. Got to ride a train ( el ) which I did the sitting meditation. I did the Qigong and angel work.</summary></entry></feed>
