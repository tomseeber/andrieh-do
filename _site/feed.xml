&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-stress-change&quot;&gt;Time Stress Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three things. I am going to be really honest, I am pretty stressed out but a few things.  Really thinking about it really to get down to business of self and reality change, a few things stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I shouldn’t have take the coding class on, but my logic was sound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should be really looking for a new job as well ( although well get to this in a second)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yup, too many commitments, just a few.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are a few I can’t say even in the blog without repercussions, but I will say others people are making somethings worse ( and thats always the way).  You have to take one thing at a time, what is the piece you can make better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now earlier in this domagick challenge, I had mentioned that yes I was dealing with alot including &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, but I do not even have time to make code changes to the template, thats kinda of a fail on my part.   I can tell too because I am starting to get angry when other people’s demons interfere with timings.  Actually dealing with other meltdowns, pettiness, and shit is why I am probably so socially isolating myself.   I do not have the bandwidth for any bullshit.  I need to reign that in.  I will be blunt, I don’t deal with emotionally charged situations that I think are way off the mark as far as reactions go well.  I generally treat it as manipulation and in some cases you’d have a tough sell to convince me its not at least unconsious control techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaw there is mine.  You cant change anyone ( ok well maybe you can with particularly potent binding magic), but at that point its not worth trying to kid yourself that its anything like a real “connection”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need to embrace a serious level of involved yet Shiva like detachment with laser focus.  Hence the actual object concentration work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That part of this challenge isn’t going so well, and that should really make sense based on what I am saying.  This is where we literally can start matching up the internal state to the social state and thus the energy state.   They all inter-relate.  Purposesly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I knew I took the bootcamp coding on as a sort of strategic idea based on the results of a Lucifer summoning.   I had to take the chance for a different road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So teaching coding should make the process of coding eh, less problematic.   Truth is, while I can do it, its still a pain in the ass, and I really am over it.  I still hate the over the top puppy dog attitude of newer developers.  Sure I have mixed feelings, on learning new stuff, but it is stressful. I love learning stuff and working through it, but not at the timeframe I have to do it in.  I like the teaching, but have really mixed feelings on the subject.  Coding is tedious to me alot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jury is out on whether or not its a good idea, but it was worth taking a shot.  I am learning about myself.  Sometimes, you have to try something to rule it out, since it looks on paper good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought I could “make the coding better” by doing that .. and maybe it will when I dont have to teach and learn, but right now.. not so sure.   There was no real way to move forward without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to the body talisman and gigong work directly.   I have a lot of energy going out and if the things do not really bring joy or there isn’t really a strong motivation, the things are intensely draining, when I am struggling with … well energy.   Too many really unsatisfying interactions and activities and thats where you start looking at where to cut and doing something different else you get drained, and then sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#The Toastmasters Problem
I am part of a Toastmaster group,  I am trying to better my public speaking.  I will be blunt, this year the toastmaster stuff is not going well.  I was “voted” in absentia as an officer and the group dynamics and group culture is horrible for me in a lot of ways.  I really am outsider, I don’t have time to work on the speeches, the group is terrible at logistics, and gives lip service to getting new people in, but really it very insular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question I always want to ask, outside the endless group pressures, is why should I care about the Toastmaster merit badges.  I want to get better at speaking and speaking for profit, end stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire for getting better at that speaking
Versus
The Reality of the vehicle not working&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is this related to Qigong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked. Qigong is about pulling energy in and out, but the real goal is to stop the bleeding of unneeded energy loss.  To make life corrections based on the how the energy us coming in and out.   This is the little talked about spiritual effect of what should happen if you are meditating on the Qigong process.  You don’t have to work nearly as hard to replenish your energy if shit is working on the point of Joy and at least you are motivated to do some things.  If you have to force yourself to do anything, like go to work in the morning cause, you hate it… thats shit is draining chi fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be motivated to make Toastmasters work.  I want to get supremely awesome at public speaking.   I am good, but not supremely awesome.  The endless group pressures, lack of value add, and nepotistic social merit badges are all seriously energy drains.  It gets in the way of the goal which DOES bring me energy, it makes the goal not possible, and it makes stuff odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, so is my frustration at not having the time to really work on the speeches with the correct time.&lt;br /&gt;
Taking together, this is actually why Qigong should not be considered so simple.  Reflecting on the energy loss accross multiple domains of life, and then trying to rebuild&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why in westernized Qigong and Buddhism, everything revolves around the concept of being happy which is definately a kinda of sugar laden mc-Qigong of spiritual diabetes.  That and fear sells well.&lt;br /&gt;
Instead we still should be concentrating on meaning, and motivation in relation to what is bringing motivation ( which is a symptom of more energy, not the cause, but you can use Qigong to build motivation because the process goes both ways).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pastoral-apostle-coaching-and-using-the-principle-of-thought&quot;&gt;Pastoral Apostle Coaching and Using the principle of Thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I met with this pretty hard co
re Christian coach who took is models for evangellical apostle missionary work and applied it to business.  Now, he had a pretty clear model and it would be very effective.   After the 5000 he was asking for in an intensive, and 400 a month for a coaching session.  Yeah that kinda of $$$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I respected the dude.  I am probably not his best choice of customer as the Christinity would throw me off, but I still might bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects of the system but most boil down to finding elements of joy and motivation, then setting expectations low enough to make progress.   A fine strategy.  What the system does though, kinda revealed another problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could do something exactly like this.  In fact, I might not sell it the way he did, but I could come up with a 4 element system that produces a 5 result .. ( ehem western elements yo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system basically uses a technique I learned in Design thinking.  Repeating a few things, like categorizing things to 3-7 things ( 5 in this case), then repeating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the flaw for a multi-dimensional thinker, all that shit is a pretty extreme and vulgar simplification of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick 5 thinks in the past, present future of tools you like.
Use 4 areas of life, in careful categories, that sumarize all reality for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the connection to McSpirituality and Mc-Answers.   This is actually what will sell.  I am not so concerned with the specifics of his system…. but what he put together.  I know I could do it and I do not, cause the Mc-Answers get to me.   Life is complicated, but all these systems simplify things too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they work, eh that is a maybe, but they have to help since they are focusing tools. So again, where does the issue lay…  If you thought I might say in me, you would be correct.  My need to think multi-dimensionally is an addition, a crutch.  Applying this to others and their needs, are pointless.  Its a need to be percieved as intelligent.  No doubt, a partial reaction to negative feedback from my first book which was accessible, but some ehem, jealous haters, trashed because it was not intellectually elitist enough.  Read that as anyone could understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I could use NLP, or I could find the energy tied to the mental construct, and use the GODDAMN Qigong.  I just have to keep doing it, starting from a clear space, think about that issue which should be nasty in feeling, and dissolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got that, its a big hint how hypnosis, Qigong and cognitive science all interact together.   Like where that line is going, well I take much further in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://andriehvitimus.com/shapeshift&quot;&gt;shapeshifting course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 11 - The Bad and the Worst</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/13/domagick-december-day-11-The-good-the-bad.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 11 - The Bad and the Worst" /><published>2018-12-13T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-13T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/13/domagick-december-day-11-The-good-the-bad</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/13/domagick-december-day-11-The-good-the-bad.html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, talk about the obsticles.

&lt;p&gt;3 am in texas right or a song goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only really had the time to banish with a LBRP, then straight object concentration (30 minutes).  I was amped up with the situation and trying to clean it so I did not do Gigong, just the focusing excercise ( anxiety being too much energy in general, and gigong would clear it out but would have also woke me up, at 3 am.. no dice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the day, I got an extra day in here.  Not lost a day, but really thought I had not done Gigong on a day I CLEARLY did, because I did ritual.. I am keeping track, but the few days of rituals, I know I did some gigong, and thought no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the Gigong work inside a wrapped LBRP, but it was really hard and I will go into why.  And did a 20 minute stint of meditaiton as well as some divinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-peoples-demons&quot;&gt;Other People’s Demons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our house, my office  has a lower ceiling.  It is in the basement.  So I have been trying to do the Gigong in our living room.   Generally, that means I have to wait till everyone goes to bed.   Today, everyone went to bed and I was setting up to use the living room and go forward, only the minute I was ready to start my step daughter decided she was not going to bed, plopped down, and turned on youtube videos on her cell phone even after I told her, she had went to bed and I was going to do gigong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was carelessly malicious, but not consciously so. In your own practice, any extended spiritual purification or alchemy will be met with resistance from other people. End Stop.  This is almost a truth.  The obsticles will always appear from other people.  Perhaps its the neighbor, perhaps its your stepdaughter, but obsticles will appear.   I recgonized it for what it is.  Generally speaking, other people are rarely going to be your ally in self change.  Our subconsious minds want to keep people in the similair boxes, automates that process, and that really often means preventing healing or growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the “motivation” was in this case, but I powered through the gigong and the angel work.  Even with noise canceling headphones, I could hear the videos playing. In part, it was probably a “how dare I”.   The living room is always a contensious area.  I kept going through it.  Now the natural reaction for me was of course anger.  I said I had needed the living room, it was ignored, and thats how the fuck you is.  This time, I kept doing the Gigong in front of the obsticle and powered through it so I could release more anger. In retrospect, the obsticle just shows the desire I have for a seperated temple space, but I know…  You need to be able to do the work anywhere, under any conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obsticles, even from those you love, only really tell you, you are on the right track.  Maybe not thank them, but mentally thank them for telling you, you are on the right track as far as the general spiritual work you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An echo in the social realms to create an unrelated obsticle, is a sign of some actual progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-habits-coming-out&quot;&gt;Bad Habits, Coming out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah so, many people know I have struggled with some health weight issues.   This is pretty fucking common knowledge  ( please do not offer me advice on this point, seriously just don’t).   After the few days, of pretty hard core ritual, I can honestly say I ate like S-h-i-t the last couple days.  Not so much BIG MAC level of shit, but shit.  Too quick of food, not really up the speed I should be doing.  I know with the computer science teaching, I have really been struggling on this front too, slipping some times, but after the few rituals … yeah problems.  Super hungry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst offending foods are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chicken Tenders ( when I am hungry at like 11 pm after class)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peanut Butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chicken Wings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non of that is exactly good. I am just always super hungry.  I am not sure what my body is trying to do, but clearly eating more isnt going to really build up any extra chi.   I have somewhat seen I could mitigate some of this with extremely spice food ( thats the wings and the Tenders).  Essentially, I take the tenders and make hot chicken, but I could easily do this with the breading and make healthy hot chicken.  At 11, I just noticed after working a full day and teaching classes, its a real struggle.   I wanted to try to get lunch excercise in, but I think I am seriously overestimating my energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-issues&quot;&gt;Technical Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I tried to get the Tumblr API to work to cross post things I post here to Tumblr.  So that is me trying to work through the “coding as fun” idea.  Its not.  The tumblr API kinda sucks ass, and I need to move to a node.js or something system to do it, since I cannot just impliment it in my liquid straight html context.  SUCK.. thats a big blocker on that.  But I have to work the node nyway, but at least the content is all in markdown.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 9 - Evocation part 2 with some meditation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/10/domagick-december-day9-evocation-work-day-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 9 - Evocation part 2 with some meditation" /><published>2018-12-10T13:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-10T13:35:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/10/domagick-december-day9-evocation-work-day-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/10/domagick-december-day9-evocation-work-day-2.html">&lt;p&gt;This was one of those, shit got real days.

&lt;p&gt;I did do the Gigong work as well and did do some object concentration in addition to the magic.  I am still seeing some weird social impacts (fallout really).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-art-of-war&quot;&gt;The Art of War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I posted this on my facebook page yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I match witchcraft of the mouth ( mostly false gossip intended to harm) with actual witchcraft, and I am pretty good at that actual magic stuff. Just be a better person, if you have a problem with me, let’s talk over coffee or something. I am generally reasonable even if I am the wronged party, and pretty forgiving. This is true not just for me, we can make things better for each other by stopping others who are doing this and just telling them.. Knock it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a few hours letter I felt a little impotent annoyance.
After 3 independant readings, from people who did not know what really was going on … all three strongly said the same thing, someone tried ( and failed to “curse” me).  I really expected it and was ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say to that is 
	&lt;strong&gt;Hahaahahahahhahaahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, you’ll need it.  Nice to be right about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-only-information&quot;&gt;There is only Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this spellwork curse was an interesting effect.  It did not get through, but it did ping the shields.  Now at the time I got a little subconsiously confused.  I actually lost my balance a little because I lost track of which body it actually was going torwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good and bad.  It does mean that the Gigong and HGA work is working.  A clear seperation between the astral body and physical is useful in every day life, but it also impedes body alchemy.  Body as talisman right.   This implies my conceptualization is very good, but while most spiritual experts will tell you this is a great thing, and it is…. it does affect your ability to ignore negative ( to you), energies.   Integrating mind, body and spirit in this way is very much a great way to live, but… it negatively affects your ability to selectively pay attention to what you are doing.  That can increase with focus exercises, but it turns the spiritual world up as well as the body intuition.  These   on the surface is all good, until you have a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western culture ( probably all culture but I will leave that alone) is really based on the denial of spiritual intution, and moreso compliance.   In more recent times, I think very few people are doing anything remotely close to what they would like to.  Jobs even connections to other people, interactions, etc… all lack substitive meaning.  Once you start doing these excercises, those tiny voices that say you should do something different… Well at least for me, they get louder.   Do the work more, the harder it is to ignore.    That brings other inner fears and demons up that you have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ignore curse work that “sticks”, or entropic elements around you, yes it tends to cause downward spirals that manifest in behavior and social realities first.   In this case, the interesting thing is that I physically lost balance… a hugely kinetic insight.   Now, I am dealing with Grieving, and shit so its not surprising. What is surprising is that it was crossed cued so far into body sensations, due to the gigong work .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;actually-did-talisman-work&quot;&gt;Actually did Talisman work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted out of the Gigong work today, but did actual talisman work of a purification nature.   With some spell work coming up that way, I did some evocational work, to take care of the problem described above.  This will relate to Qigong, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this evocation is with a set of powerful non-book spirits that could only be described as “alien”, possibly cthulean ( but they aren’t from that paradign).  They are really not intelligent and really are mission focused ( almost can do nothing but eat).  These spirits are also verbally un-named.   So what is outlined is a kinetic seal for the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evocation was as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://andriehvitimus.com/shapeshift&quot;&gt;my shapeshifting course&lt;/a&gt;, and Hands on Chaos Magic.  These are things I have a long term relationship with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every spirit has a internal representation that arises from the interaction between you and it.  Some spirits will resist both a seal to call it, and a form in visual sense.  In fact, a spirit which resists conceptualization are far more difficult spirits to deal with.   That said, it is impossible to resist having at least a kinetic set of “effects”.  Your body will react at least.  If it didn’t, there really isnt even a real way that the spirit is interacting with you.  Your body most at least react in some way, as this is some sort of hook into the subconsious mind.  It is easy to ignore these reactions, but for these type of alien spirits, its critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Qigong actually teaches you in a classical sense, to actually pay real close attention to those body sensations, and then basically try to map out energy blocks and some body sensations to ill-adapted energy.  That is a gross high level overview.  If you are working in that way, it is not so hard to map up alien energies and then when you have a working map, summon something only with the set of “reactions”.  As you move forward in working with an Alien spirit from the “outer” whatever, you just build a interface internally. We can call that a relationship, but with things that don’t classically allow themselves to be anthropormized, relationship implies way too much humanity.  Interface is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/interface.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Interface Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have kinda a process to interface building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Body Reactions, possibly other sensations accross multiple sensory channells to a presense.  Write them down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banish each time.  Throughly.  Take accounting of your personality, and anything that happens.  This is risky magick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeat sensations in meditation through submodality work, till you have “pressence” present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to repeat these excercises until you can get some sort of real-world validation that the presense is not just a servitor or thoughtform.  That hardly matters, as a thoughtform can be quite effective… but if something is clearly not a thoughtform, and clearly alien in nature… EXTRA care needs to be taken, especially if it resisting changing its energy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HINT:  you can usually change the sensory information a thoughtform produces in you, thus changing the thoughtform… it should change the thoughtform.   Spirits of note and alien, will resist this type of change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you work through the interface with a spirit, you should increasingly build an understanding of it, and it should increasingly be able to get real world results on the point that the spirit can work on in this world.  That may be highly limited and specific, as alien shit does not really know about the human world much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like advanced Qigong, or even Taosist fuckery of a non-dogmatic sort, it is. Although this is not Taoist sorcery of the sort commercially sold and mass marketed.  Its in my shapeshifting course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case particularly, the spirit was sent to clean up and just eat any negative spellwork lingering out there that just bounced off me, and continue to eat whatever it wants from there that is still tied to the negative spellwork at me.  So if a person is a sloppy magician throwing curses, well you can kinda get what this would do.  Oh did I menion, for the stalkers out there throwing down, the alien thing in this case does not particullar care what energy it eats, so a banishing ritual will just give it more “energy” thats connected to the original curse work once it locks in.   As I said. &lt;strong&gt;hahahahah, Good luck&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spirit has been trained through the interface to actually only respond to talismans where the blood matches my blood, and only to where the blood on the talisman is the same as the person who is making the request.  Think of this as a double authentication key, mostly cause I dont want an alien intelligence of a entropic and alien sort, connected directly to my body Chi and thus mucking about about my subconsious mind.   Instead, I have to have a talisman with a double blood key and no other simulation of sympathetic links can work.   That’s a relatively anal spiritually secure talisman link, beyond what is probably needed 99.9999% of the time.  I am just thorough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost immediately after sending the spirit with a second curse which will go unmentioned, I felt alot more clear headed about what to do where on social fronts.   The real reason this is all confusing, is simply there is alot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/04/december-talismans-day-2.html&quot;&gt;dead tissue to clear&lt;/a&gt; out from these fronts. I have trained this alien intelligence to also via the methods above, to carry other curses while its feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now just because I have a interface with these kinds of monsters.  I still sat down, banished, and did a full 30 minutes of Object concetration and meditation to freaking insure my subconsious mind was cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 6 - Working Hard after Work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/07/domagick-day6-working-hard-combining-tools.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 6 - Working Hard after Work" /><published>2018-12-07T02:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-07T02:35:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/07/domagick-day6-working-hard-combining-tools</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/07/domagick-day6-working-hard-combining-tools.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/qigongFeature.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Qigong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did A few things.   First my Bro jason was around and he did some Qigong but this was wrapped inside a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos026.html&quot;&gt;LBRP&lt;/a&gt;.   By wrapped inside, I mean we would go through the angel projections, the kaballistic cross, and after you have asserted the connection to Goddhood, but before a clossing Kabbalisrtic cross.  We were again using Luke Chen’s Chilel Pull chi up and down method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason was saying he felt like he was having kidney stone problems right before we started.   After the set, with the additional Angel support, he was so so impressed by this combination, that he asked for a video set of the Chilel.   He said after we were done with the Gigong and the medtation work, he didnt feel like the kidney stone was just dissloved out. Enough so that hes going to try some more.   This combination is something I tried before and it does seem to multiply the effectiveness of the Gigong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did the full set and then did straing up object concentration work.  I 	am starting to work out some additional helpers for the health kick ( including starting some gym work and revisiting the my fitness pall apt).  Going to switch to the 8 cade brocade soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 5 - Domagick, more bad social news, reflection</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/06/domagick-day-5-december-reflections.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 5 - Domagick, more bad social news, reflection" /><published>2018-12-06T02:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-06T02:35:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/06/domagick-day-5-december-reflections</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/06/domagick-day-5-december-reflections.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/punches.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Punch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;chop-wood-carry-water-in-the-underworld&quot;&gt;Chop Wood Carry Water In the Underworld&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Qigong is not trivial, its just not and it has weird affects as you get better at magic and the spiritual stuff.   So in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/bz8yd6xux41vjf4/11-14-2018-Death%20to%20Andrieh%20Vitimus.md?dl=0&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;…  In this article, I was basically ruminating that I was still in the Eye of Shiva.  What I mean by that, is that everything is kinda destructing around me.  That the funeral caused me to be so overloaded with death energies that, more or less, it was going to take something with it, and posited that it is a magical name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am seriously energy compromised, I am seriously not social.  Introvert by nature, but I have felt particuarlly like my whole social reality isn’t working for me and its not really clear what/when/how to change that given my time constraints ( 2 jobs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday, I had one social contact(who is basically, pretty popular person), basically all but declare war on me.. not so directly, obviously, they know in a pound for pound magical “issue”, I would put them in the grave or worse magically speaking since I do not stop or take any prisoners, but their intention was pretty clear.   If are the person reading this that this is true, better believe it and I do not have any sense of mercy or restraint on this.   I am shit public figure actually.  I know that, I really need alot of help with that actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am actually a really dangerous magician.  Then I had a second friend sort of student kinda also disrepect me, and worst they probably didnt mean it.  Same day.   Kinda fucking hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not things I brought on myself, not directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was trying to lay low, obviously since if you have been reading, I have been fucking morning for real&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and I am just getting out of an MBA program and teaching Computer science now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-did-i-bring-it-on-myself&quot;&gt;Or did I bring it on myself?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an experienced magician, Qigong does not quite do what you might think.  Qigong by itself is enough to start shifting reality if done with sincerity.  By sincerity, clear focus, good signal, augmenting it with the 5 senses, basically everything covered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://andriehvitimus.com/shapeshift&quot;&gt;my shapeshifting course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eye of Shiva, that which remains is truth.   Think about that. EVerything else gets destroyed, except that which is truth.  We can argue about what that is too.. with pratical magic.. no  it does not need,  On &lt;a href=&quot;http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/04/december-talismans-day-2.html&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;, I literally did a working to Shiva so this should not be surprising.  I am not really suprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As within, As without&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is as you changed the inside you must change the outside.  Change the outside, you change the inside.  Qigong clears the inner energy from dead enegeries, and thus the universe just clears out the dead material and in this case that means social.  Death takes the weakess tissues or weakest parts of your reality and claims the sick parts first.   For me, that definately is the social reality and definately peopling under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that setback, I have to re-think things.   How do I create, not just let things get destroyed on this front.  Maybe its just a matter of clearing out the bad energies, letting shit go, and then rebuilding.   But it still hurts a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will do the Gigong today, and do some meditation.. object concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 4 - Domagic… just doing a movie</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/05/domagick-day-4-december.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 4 - Domagic... just doing a movie" /><published>2018-12-05T02:35:37-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-05T02:35:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/05/domagick-day-4-december</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/december-2018/2018/12/05/domagick-day-4-december.html">&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I fed the spirits, did the Gigong, meditated.
Was very very tired today… and its still 1 when I am starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not the most exciting magic, but alas at least I am trying.   I have been thinking I need to do alot more talismans to destroy… or linking items and embuing those items to clear things out.   I will add more later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not fix the programming issues, so this is still broke ( at least in part )….   Keep on keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fed the spirits and did the work. Well I fed the spirits, did the Gigong, meditated.
