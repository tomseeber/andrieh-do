<p>Tested Qigong with my student and did a good 30 minutes of macrocosmic orbit.   One of the gifts I recieved was a buddha board.  It turns out this is a unbelievable talisman for spirit work in general, and just kinda cool.    The buddha board actual uses clear water and disappears as you write.   So it has a temporary ink scroll effect.</p>

<p>Zac and I summoned:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Xi-Wang-Mu.jpeg" alt="Xi-Wang-Mu" /></p>

<h1 id="xi-wang-mu-西王母">Xi Wang Mu 西王母</h1>
<h2 id="queen-mother-of-the-west">Queen Mother of the West</h2>
<h2 id="devourer-of-men">Devourer of Men</h2>
<h2 id="granter-of-life">Granter of Life</h2>
<h2 id="teacher-of-the-immortals">Teacher of the Immortals</h2>

<p>This was a spirit that was bothering me to make contact because Zac had previously made contact but it just didn’t go right.</p>

<p>The ritual was actually one of the few non-purification rituals I  have done in the last 20 days, although arguably it was empowering.  This spirit is complicated.</p>

<p>This ritual was almost purely Shamanic aka just fucking do it, not much ritual, but there were some ritual components.</p>

<p>So first we sanctified the Buddha Board and the space.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure I understood the spirit from the initial contact the spirit had made with me.  Now, I had very few details about the spirit outside of the name.</p>

<p>I went into a shamanic trance and started drawing on the board.  The board only lasts a minute, so its phenomenal automatic drawing/writing tool for trance.</p>

<p>What did I draw.  Foxes, mountains, even the description as a truly beautiful woman was all right on the money.   I described a spirit that has the keys to life and death and is somewhat detached and humorous about that.   Then started relaying message through the board ( writing them down) and they would disappear.</p>

<p>Zac did divinations.   Everything was very consistent with historical information of the older versions of Xi Wang Mu, not the newer salvationist narratives.  Then shit got personal, and we tried to do a working directly with channeled energies from the spirit and into the board.</p>

<p>To me, this seemed to become a moving spell like a animation as I was drawing it, because the board itself fades, it allows for a sort of moving sigil, or series of temporary</p>

<p>This was a very cool experience and meets a lot of where I need to be working right now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Portable.</li>
  <li>Minimalist.</li>
  <li>Essentialist</li>
</ul>

<p>Now honestly the board disappears too quickly for normal sigil work, or at least you’d have to repetitively draw it.</p>

<p>There were some issues where the medium ( ahem Zac) interrupted in the spell work.   SO, I had to teach my bro some things about that style of work :)</p>

<p>Now that said,  It was actually a very life affirming ritual ( she has access to the peaches that the immortals eat to become Taoist immortals).</p>

<p>So really the talisman work her was to sanctify the buddha board.</p>
