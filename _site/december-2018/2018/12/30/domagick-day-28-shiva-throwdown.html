<h1 id="back-to-the-beginning-sorta">Back to the Beginning Sorta</h1>
<p>I was do these #domagick Challenges and get to day 28 and there is a bigger sort of climax.   Almost always, the last 2 days are somewhat anti-climatic.</p>

<p>So I did a multi-hour ritual to transform and extend the purification.  Shiva is the destroyer, and definitely the destroyer of problems too.</p>

<p>It turns out the people living in our space that abruptly left after the major angel work, left some unfortunate negatively energy embed items in our house that also happened to be likely bloodied.  I don’t know why you’d think it was a good idea to leave anything with blood on it with a talented sorcerer, but these people where not thinking clearly.  I am not entirely sure this was a intentional spell, but it certainly was a negative talisman.</p>

<h2 id="om-namah-shiva-in-fire">Om Namah Shiva in fire</h2>
<p>I did a modified Fire Puja with a bonfire.  You can get the <a href="http://www.magical30.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FireHoma.pdf">simplified fire puja I do</a>.</p>

<p>First I started the fire up in the traditional way.  Coconut and Ghee with Camphor.  I did well over 2 mala ( 108) of Ganesh mantras.   Consciously building up the fire with energy.   I kept going until the fire was really built.   Then at that point I switched to Shiva.</p>

<p>Even building the fire up in a sanctified fashion, I felt there was a lot of baleful spirits present creating distractions.  You know the spirit in the corner of the eye situation.  It was annoying, but I kept going.</p>

<p>I had also prepared logs with my negativity and others made logs too.  Zac Lui was present.</p>

<p>I started places the additional logs and the fire got really freaking hot.</p>

<p>This takes some concentration to do the mantra work and actually have some magick working while building the fire.</p>

<p>After the fire was really going and it was clear Shiva was present, I put the entropic and bloodied talismans into the fire.</p>

<p>Shit got UNBELIEVABLY Hot,  I mean what the fuck hot.</p>

<p>So the best way to think of this fire, and really what I kept seeing and feeling was the cremation grounds in India.  That I was burning the skulls and bodies of the issues.</p>

<h1 id="where-are-we-shiva">Where Are We Shiva</h1>
<p>When the fire has built and going.   Everything went black.   I could see the outlines of Shiva, right near me.  This was not ehem, a visualization.  I could close my eyes and see him dancing in the fire, easily.   No, this was with eyes open.  I kept doing the mantras till the other bloodied wood talismans and wood logs were unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Yeah, this was a long as ritual.</p>

<p>I felt like this was a type of death or the void.   There was stillness.   I felt like Shiva definitely heard what I needed.  Transmute the bad into good, but I think, he took a look at a more.  The Hindu spirits get results, but they do it gently I found.  Coaxing you to move forward internally, and making the external elements show you are on the right path.   The Hebrew Angels are kinda dicks and if you know how to ground them into the world can work quite fast ( BTW, most people don’t do this, they work the angels in a “mental” sphere ).  Sometimes you need dicks, like when people are leaving negative talismans in your home who are guests, but sometimes you need coaxing.  I need coaxing now.</p>

<p>Writing this, I am almost crying.  Its was a very sublime experience.</p>

<p>By this point, the annoyances of other spirits were gone and no longer preventing the work. You’d expect that when Lord Ganesha  and Lord Shiva go to town.</p>

<p>As this was a greater purification, I counted this as Qigong and meditation.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JfP8qPX.jpg" alt="Existential Dead" /></p>
<h2 id="not-really-ok-after-it">Not Really Ok After it.</h2>
<p>I was really not ok after this ritual.  I will be honest.   I tried to eat ( with poor food, fuck xmas food), but still was not really ok.  I just tried to get the “Void” out of my head, but struggled.  Spiritual people might be, totes dude, but really I couldn’t sit to do computer science work for my class.  After sleeping for 3 hours, I was ok.  Think about it like existential Chapel Perilous type moment.   Really great for growth on spiritual progression.  Really bad when you are totally time screwed.</p>

<h1 id="still-in-a-fight-though">Still in a Fight though.</h1>
<p>Shiva is very write, I need to be coaxed now.  I am still in a fight with the greater conceptuality of an malignant anxiety entity.</p>

<p>So I played video games, I played too late to get the void out of my head.  This was a trigger for other people’s self-esteem and anxiety issues which did clean up faster.  There are other self-issues that are getting to me regarding space, clearly some of the underlying issues come from previous trauma of the courts, but the fact I clearly can see the reaction and clearly can feel the process and have clear understanding of the why allows me to use some SWISH nlp patterns to deconstruct them.  Doing that bro, I am doing.  Some other issues with space and visitors, I am not sure how to address.   These issues are not important.</p>

<p><strong>What is important however, is that each day I am doing one thing, one step to move foward</strong>   Ultimately, that is best thing anyone can do regardless of whatever the situation is.  Don’t let the slick marketing of any other authors actually put you off.  There shit is there, despite the illusion.  Everyone has these very human problems, what is important is that you do something about it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Change yourself or work to change the world, really both change the world.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="the-coding-aspect-of-this-challenge-fell-apart">The Coding Aspect of this Challenge fell apart</h2>
<p>Well I was able code the Markdown, and I like that.. but did not one fucking thing on theming work or actual coding.  Let me admit it, I dont like doing it much.   That “code for fun thing”, it ain’t me.   Time to get my management on real fast and work on that front.  Maybe there is some reclaiming of this, after all the purification</p>
