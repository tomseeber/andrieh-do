    <p>Well, shit I had to do some evocation of a fairy nature.   This tends to be how it goes, I put off a whole bunch of magic and had to catch up on it.  Fortunately, fairy magic rarely tends to further drain me, although I did not want to really take away from the body alchemy and Qigong work, but will have to the next couple days unfortunately.</p>

<p>I did do the Gigong work as well and did do some object concentration in addition to the magic.  I am still seeing some weird social impacts (fallout really).  Going to add some deep meditations not just object concentration to the list.  Divinatory meditation and readings ( not just divinations), since the work is raising some questions.</p>

<p>The work I did do which involves an in-place talisman already placed in the groundâ€¦  Shit was powerful and strong, and left me completing feeeling astrally burned.   Fun times right !!!</p>

<p>I was definatelly awake.</p>
