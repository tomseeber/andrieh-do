<p># Tower Card</p>

<p>A couple days ago, I did a reading and the tower card kept coming out.   Obviously if you read this blog through, that happened.   The tower is not needfully always bad.   Just implies sudden change.   That definitely happened.  Now I have to re-access things.</p>

<p>I am definitely doing better as far as my emotional state, definitely more strong after the death of my mentor but there is a lot to think about that I have some room to think about.</p>

<h2 id="todays-work">Today’s Work.</h2>
<p>Today I did 20 minutes of Microcosmic Orbit in a very NeiGong fashion.   Additionally I did some divinations to just check myself before I wrecked myself.   I am going to do some cleaning work ( physically re-organizing space).</p>

<h2 id="problem-my-eating-has-tanked">Problem: My Eating has tanked</h2>

<p>All the drama and the grieving, I have reverted to some bad habits around food given the stress of the death and bat shit crazy people in my home.</p>

<h3 id="solution-proposed">Solution Proposed</h3>
<p>Starting with the my fitness pal app again.  That should shame me enough to get it to work.
This isn’t going to help with the exercise point, that I have to seriously think about how with teaching the classes.</p>

<h2 id="problem-doing-the-magic-has-actually-hurt-other-aspects-of-time">Problem: Doing the magic has actually hurt other aspects of time</h2>

<p>I have done some big lifting but that takes enormous time.  I am well behind on what I need to do for my classes, let alone what I would like to do in my metaphysical teachings.   Going to have to a bunch of cutting.   I mean this was just qigong and then morphed into some major heavy lifting rituals.   That wont be sustainable once classes start again for me</p>

<h3 id="solution-">Solution ???</h3>
<p>No good ones.
Yeah I don’t have a good one for this.  Time management starts to not work when you are overcommitted.</p>

<h2 id="biking">Biking?</h2>
<p>Hahahaah it got cold, but seriously, I need to get on the training, but the time is really hard.</p>

<p>I know I a was seriously overburdened before the death, and then the stupid drama.   I probably needed to do the serious cleansing magic to even get to where I could think about the problems and take action.</p>

<h2 id="other-issues">Other issues</h2>
<p>Just cause I got a victory on the anxiety front in the house, although not through the means I wanted but really people were seriously contemplating suicide in the home I own.  They should have been in a hospital, but they would not allow that.  They all needed to go.   Really I was just trying to do Angel work to really spiritually clean the house to give me some space to breath.   There are still issues challenges, and I think that fight with the conceptualization of anxiety as a malignant entity directly attacking is far from over.  At least I have some space to breath as I am coasting into the end of the magical 30.</p>
