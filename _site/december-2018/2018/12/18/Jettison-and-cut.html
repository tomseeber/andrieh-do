Jettison.  The message from the universe.  The toastmaster word of the day.  Apropos exact message from the universe.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Jettison 
	to throw away or get rid of something that is not wanted or needed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>3 days of emotional turmoil basically caused by other people and my reaction to their reactions. I am partially to blame and I’ll own it.  Some of my decisions led to the place I am at.  Sometimes, it can’t get better till you clear out the poison and just admit, you fucked up.</p>

<p>Let me be really blunt with the Qigong and other stuff I am doing, I can see my living conditions and lifestyle is not at all emotionally safe. Quite the opposite. I don’t have a safe space, and have stopped trusting my support network. I turn around and if I don’t get it from one angle I am getting it from another from the people around me.  Again, as the Shiva work all suggested, its social poisons dragging a lot of me down.</p>

<p>A lot of this, is kinda just too many people living in the same area,  some of it is not. There is simply a lot of emotions, that are not expressible even in what should be my space.  Its all really killing me one encounter at a time, and somedays I feel like I am losing it.</p>

<p>The energy work is keeping that from happening, and allowing me to <strong>detach as much as possible</strong>. What the energy work is revealing, is the reality so I can do something about it.  Theres not much renewing going on, but at least I am getting some ideas.</p>

<p>So I have to find and seek out the wins, allow the garbage to dissolve in the eye of Shiva, and keep moving forward.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, the drama continued from yesterday and when I did what was actually asked of me by others, I made it worse because they didn’t really mean it and then I had already done what was asked.   It made things worse of course. Vaguepost aside, and sorry about that…  I need to get back to trusting my intuition and being even more stubborn.</p>

<p>At Toastmasters too, I was further reminded some shit needs to change.  I  literally told people I was going to bring plates and did it in the google sheets.  Someone brought plates and stuff and they wanted just to make sure it was done.  I was done with that group, right there.   Tired of being disrespected. Really tired.  Jettison is the word of the day.</p>

<p>Honestly, I feel like more and more, I probably after the death of my family member, I am in that realm of highly functioning depressed.  I am not sure it is really chemical, but it feels like every day, I have to deal with something insanely emotionally charged, that is extraordinarily draining to me. I cant shake it or get the space to shake it.   Like I said, physically speaking, my living situation is not emotionally safe for me. I kinda only have myself to blame for that based on a host of decisions, and because of that I cant get my footing.</p>

<p>I can admit today, after the meditation and work that truth about the emotional insecurity.  Before I was in denial.  Denial is not really a place where you can make change.  At least now, I can start using Qigong and reframing to toughen myself up, and reframe and rebuild.</p>

<p>All that is to say, what do I do about it?   Right now, I have some pretty good ideas.  Energy is the problem but I am going to have some time without work which means I can do larger rituals.   The first thing I will do is a much bigger and aggressive uncrossing with the archangel Micheal. There is other spirits I can work with and will try some of that too. Then keep doing the Qigong and a 1080 fire homa ( probably more of a bonfire) with Shiva… again truly forcing the negative energy to alchemize one way or another.</p>

<p>So today, yes I did the Qigong today and LBRP, but I did it in my office at work.  Honestly, right now, despite all the bullshit at work, it feels more emotionally safe.  I did meditatively walk as well, and did 20 minutes of object concentration.  That’s why I can write about it, with some honestly and detachment.</p>
