<p>Post the challenge, I took a day off was a no-mag.</p>

<p>There are several things I took away from this challenge.</p>

<h1 id="one">One</h1>
<p>I have to admit I am way overburdened, so much so that there was more then a few warning signals even with what was going on in the house before the death of my mentor and other deaths.   Death is never going to be easy, but I was at best tolerating stuff.</p>

<h1 id="second">Second</h1>
<p>Heavy clearing work as much as I did, generates resentment which also has to be cleared.  I am doing alot more of the housework now, and using that as a meditation, see 4th way stuff.</p>

<h1 id="third">Third</h1>
<p>Things are not bothering me nearly as much which is huge progress, but I there are still attempts to violate boundaries.  Just a lot less and more manageable.  This tells me that like going down to point 4, I still have some issues on this point to correct.</p>

<h1 id="four">Four</h1>
<p>Conceptualizing the overwhelming external anxiety as an external entity and throwing down as if it was a real spiritual attack did work, but clearly I haven’t won yet.  Its probably not possible to win actually.  Probably at best you can do is one step in front of the other.</p>

<h1 id="five">Five</h1>
<p>I let alot of things slide to do the cleansing work and have been in this under-seige mindset.  I went from grieving to intense cleaning.  Given point 4, not sure I can really work on more aspirational goals but I can take one day at a time.</p>

<h1 id="six">Six</h1>
<p>I probably have to admit, I don’t really like teaching computer science or more correctly, I dont want to spend all my time preparing and the curriculum is WAY WAY limited.  I am going to try to apply for side hustles at real colleges thinking that might be the ticket actually instead of the boot camp model, which I don’t really like and does not really give me much flexibility at all.</p>

<h1 id="seven">Seven</h1>
<p>A big part of the pain point I was meditating on was the social bullshit I had to deal with.  I have been working on my MBA so I let a lot of things go in the public author thing.  People I thought I was cool with, well I got thrown away as garbage.  Actually it kinda hurt my feelings. 
I will be correcting this with both magic and content production, and I will be following my more “Chicago” Rules, as I mean No Quarter will be given and back to pretty aggressive magic for the witch craft of the mouth. Literally, looking back at the reading for a year, I totally thought this SHOULD be the course of action.  Magical Brass Knuckles and doing shit. I miss doing public rituals in that I love the real artistry of it, but I don’t miss conventions too much.  I do like smaller conventions, but I am just not a big partier or ass kisser, yep no.   The performance and the magick.. that that I love much.  Now I just wish I could get a few hundred dollars for costuming and props for each ritual so I could make them SUPER awesome pretty.</p>

<h1 id="current-projects-and-aspirations">Current projects and Aspirations</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Back to real body alchemy work, despite the time fuckery I put myself into.
    <ul>
      <li>Well, I got my Gym membership back.</li>
      <li>Gonna try to get up at but fuck early, and go work out in the morning, we will see about that.</li>
      <li>Got an armband thing for my phone, so I could do tai chi, serious walking, indoor biking.</li>
      <li>Going to seriously be anal about my fitness pal and journaling this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I am not sleeping like I should.
    <ul>
      <li>It does not fell like this is anxiety, just like frustration that I couldn’t actually get a real vacation cause of the amount of cleansing work I did.</li>
      <li>I really do not like mornings naturally at all, but I could do some solar sun rise shit that maybe will make it more interesting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I am going to reclaim a working office/working space, but I would love to recreate what I call my dark temple don’t know how to do that one with the space, but I have some ideas.  I have the space have to con people into helping me move… I predict that will happen in may… yep that busy.</li>
