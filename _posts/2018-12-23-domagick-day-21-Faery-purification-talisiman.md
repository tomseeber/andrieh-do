# Go Hard or Go home.

So on line with this do magick challenge, I performed a purification ritual, a much larger Faery Purification ritual with the goal of a creating a greater talisman resonate with a specific type of faery entity.   I will not say much more about this talisman but will say it took me a good 5-6 hours and that was in a DEEP shamanic state, I mean deep. 

Nope, no pictures my friends.  No pictures of my talismans.  I got the talisman done, but its not quite as pretty yet and I need to build a makeshift forge to do this. This talisman is directly related to the post [fighting the anxiety demon around me](http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/19/domagick-day-17-Changing-the-dynamic.html).  It is purposely attuned to help fight that, and some other issues of a similar to spiritual strenghtening.

More details, nope.  Yes they do more then that, but nope nope nope I am not saying.  6 hours of work, not trivial spirits.   

Noticeable effects, on certain targets.  Yep...  They are shy spirits, cant say more.
