Yeah, talk about the obsticles.  Even the dog peed on the bed which created chaos, entropy, and lots of anxiety.  So many pain points, and all these downward spirals from that point.   

3 am in texas right or a song goes.

I only really had the time to banish with a LBRP, then straight object concentration (30 minutes).  I was amped up with the situation and trying to clean it so I did not do Gigong, just the focusing excercise ( anxiety being too much energy in general, and gigong would clear it out but would have also woke me up, at 3 am.. no dice.)

I was going to write a angry post but Im not.  I am just going to say I did something.
