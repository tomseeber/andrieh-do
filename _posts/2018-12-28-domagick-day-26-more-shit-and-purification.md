So there was more full fuckery when people were moving today.  Left some nice little curse work behind around by the people leaving.  Realize we didn't charge them rent.  Fun Times. Endless drama.   Really negative energy.

So first, I took all the negative vibes, curses and etc and dissolved them in a purification ceremony at the lake.  Dissolving ceremony to pull and capture the negativity and dissolve it in the lake. 

Additionally, I went and cleaned the two rooms with extreme cleansing magic.  There was some complications and it took a lot of energy, but I got everything cleared and did the clearing a few ways.   Made sure everything was cleared and threw away the remaining stuff the people left behind.

There were still hiccups, and you could tell some of the things left behind negatively interfered with some of the people.   Cleared out all the shit.

Doing the purification rituals inlui of Qigong.
