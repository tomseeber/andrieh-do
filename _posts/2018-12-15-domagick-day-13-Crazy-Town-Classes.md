This was a day that I actually had to build a talisman, accidently.  Not just Qigong. So this one has a story.  I did the Qigong and the LBRP, although seriousy thinking of adding middle pillar work to my work.

I did do the Qigong and meditation work, although I am struggling with the object concentration.  

This talisman has an interesting story though.   So I was putting together a night stand shelf.  It is that one I put up that first.  

So at first, I was building the shelf, no issues.  Then I tried to add a couple hooks in, and bamo...   When screwing the hook in, the small brass hook literally twisted in half.  

Yeah so about that.  So the part of metal sticking out from the shelf was sharp.   I went downstairs and started working on this with the dremal...  Who was there.???

Papa Legba, and he had things to say.  I was instructed to take items from his altar and decorate the shelf, to dress the entire shelf with Van Van oil, and bless it with both florida water and some frankensense which I did.   Then I put the pieces together, and there was some dicussions about that, where he was fucking with me and what incredients to put on there... but eventually we came to what we were going to do... He was just trying to be fun and playful, trying to get me to lighten up.  Point totally taken and totally correct.  I have too much to do and shit ain't fun.

Now to Papa's credit, I was going to put my dream journal on this along with my tablet and phone, but I was shown images of just doing some simple minimalistic candle spells just with this 5" shelf next to a chair.  Dream candle work,  I could double wall the candle, and then glue the candle holder to a [five inch base](https://www.originalbotanica.com/7-day-silver-candle-holder/) (which I promptly found on Original Products hahah, he was not kidding).  Dream candle work is interesting, here is the basic skinny.

# So here is a gross simplification of candle dream magic.

- Banish or start with a cleansing bath.
- Decorate candle appropriately
- Re-read Andrieh's unpublished fire magic book or tell him to finish it (hahahaha).
- Dress candle and meditate with it, if sigil activate it.  Work with this in a relaxation to focus way.
- Lay in bed ( after activating), meditate to sleep with the candle.
- Banish when you wake.  

I could write a whole book on this, but thats the basic skinny.
