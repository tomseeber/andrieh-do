This was one of those, shit got real days.  This is a second day of working with in ground talismans to calm down some waves of just anxiety and bullshit.  Sometimes you got to work the external to change the internal.   SO again, no Gigong  :(  

Intially this is not a fail for this challenge, as I was doing greater purification external work and that really means it fits within the scope and I intially said, do what you got to do on this.  Have a problem with that $$@@# off..  ok its not that serious.  I did a 2 hour ritual stint of enviromental purification.   This is one time that I will just say, I am leaving it unsaid.   Zac Lui can confirm the work (as per the in person verification of actually doing the work), and I will leave it alone from there.

I will say very fried after two days of ritual work.  HAHAH.. happens.
