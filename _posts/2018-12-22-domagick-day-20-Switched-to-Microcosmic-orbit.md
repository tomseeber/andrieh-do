Today was an insanely busy day.   I had my friend Zac Lui, who is a Chinese medicine expert.  I had him test my progress rehabilitating my energy system after my teachers death.

So this is day 20.   He was pretty clear, VERY good progress.   My Microcosmic orbit was strong tight and fast.  It impressed him.  I did this for a good 20 minutes after an LBRP. 

So he did a pretty through look, thats what he concluded.   Verification of progress.
