# Domagick Day 1
*Day 1, December 9, 2018*


## PreWork
So I decided to ha ve a few harder things with this.   I've had alot of death energies around me. *[ You can read more about that here ]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/rd4eblp1oa0advu/starting.md?dl=0)*, or [ More changing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bz8yd6xux41vjf4/11-14-2018-Death%20to%20Andrieh%20Vitimus.md?dl=0)  These are unfinished.   But I kinda decided to just do things in markdown or start coding..   No wordpress nothing like that.  <http://google.com>

Straight only code I develop myself.  Yes oddly this is part of the talisman work.  Reconditing a skill set and accepting it.    

The plan is to work to get on the excercise program more throughly... Start with 1 Gigong a day and move up to 3-4 sets of gigong a day ( thats only like an hour) with a whole bunch of escalating excercise.  

Unfortantely for me. I have 2 jobs now ( and one job is very time consuming), it is teaching computer science classes and my day job.   So very little time... 

**you got to work with what you got**

## Checking in with Myself
So after the death of my teacher. and a few other things, I had some difficult times even meditating properly.  So I have been doing some major pufication on my holy guardian angel point.  I mean active magic, still can do.. spirit calls, no problem.  But really, Zen style meditation really tells you were you are at.   Simple meditation.  Object concentration on a single point, no thoughts, no distractions.   

At first, this was painful to even do.   Really painful after the grieving.   But I worked before now to get it up to a hardcore and honest 5 minutes.  I kinda feel into a everything is pointless loop after doing some of the funeral rights.. I was grieving pretty hard for a teacher.  Shit happens.  I will write more on this.

## Meditation and Magical Work

Did the meditation outside, did Chilel for 20 minutes with 10 minutes of sitting still with object concentration.  If I was being fully honest,  it was 2 sets of 5  minutes of striaght object concentrations with no thinking.    I did the meditation and gigong outside ( 50 degree weather.   Will do a 3rd set of meditaiton.

Over the next couple days, will have a full plan down.
