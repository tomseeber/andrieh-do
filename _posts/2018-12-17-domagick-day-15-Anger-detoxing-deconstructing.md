Took 2 long walks.
Got to ride a train ( el ) which I did the sitting meditation.  I did the Qigong and angel work.

At night, some people had moved stuff on me, and I got real angry.  Feeling of trapped and no respect.  There is alot of frustration over this, I know the real real reason was that I felt like I had no control.  Its the sensation of the walls closing in, and people giving you no space to recover.

Its been a rough couple days with this.  One fight, then another. 


In all seriousness, I really miss the meditative train rides.  Writing the blog posts a day or later removes much of the viciousness of the experience, so it less raw after a day. 

A sure sign, the banishing and Qigong is working as is the banishing rituals.
