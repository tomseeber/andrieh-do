# Chop Wood Carry Water In the Underworld
Sometimes Qigong is not trivial, its just not and it has weird affects as you get better at magic and the spiritual stuff.   So in [this article](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bz8yd6xux41vjf4/11-14-2018-Death%20to%20Andrieh%20Vitimus.md?dl=0)...  In this article, I was basically ruminating that I was still in the Eye of Shiva.  What I mean by that, is that everything is kinda destructing around me.  That the funeral caused me to be so overloaded with death energies that, more or less, it was going to take something with it, and posited that it is a magical name.

When I am seriously energy compromised, I am seriously not social.  Introvert by nature, but I have felt particuarlly like my whole social reality isn't working for me and its not really clear what/when/how to change that given my time constraints ( 2 jobs).

Since yesterday, I had one social contact(who is basically, pretty popular person), basically all but declare war on me.. not so directly, obviously, they know in a pound for pound magical "issue", I would put them in the grave or worse magically speaking since I do not stop or take any prisoners, but their intention was pretty clear.   If are the person reading this that this is true, better believe it and I do not have any sense of mercy or restraint on this.   I am shit public figure actually.  I know that, I really need alot of help with that actually.

But I am actually a really dangerous magician.  Then I had a second friend sort of student kinda also disrepect me, and worst they probably didnt mean it.  Same day.   Kinda fucking hurt. 

These are not things I brought on myself, not directly.  

**I was trying to lay low, obviously since if you have been reading, I have been fucking morning for real**
**and I am just getting out of an MBA program and teaching Computer science now.**

Or did I bring it on myself? 

If you are an experienced magician, Qigong does not quite do what you might think.  Qigong by itself is enough to start shifting reality if done with sincerity.  By sincerity, clear focus, good signal, augmenting it with the 5 senses, basically everything covered in [my shapeshifting course](http://andriehvitimus.com/shapeshift)

In the eye of Shiva, that which remains is truth.   Think about that. [Day 2]()
