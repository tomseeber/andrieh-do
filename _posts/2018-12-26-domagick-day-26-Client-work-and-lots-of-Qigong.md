I had to do some Paimon Work which involved creating a talisman to change their influence levels.  I can't say exactly what was done, but this work was to demonstrate how to do extended drawing or scroll magic.   Yep no pictures again, client work.

I also re-asserted the angelic purification for the house and doing some Qigong work ( full Chilel set).
