Well, I could lie and saying it was a carefree Sunday, but it wasn't.  Lot's of drama, some of which was my fault.  I will admit that. Lots of times, I have to admit, I do not react well to anxiety and the feeling of being attacked.   I react very poorly.  Things got out of control. Conflict yeah.  

- Fight, Recovery. 
- Sid the meditation. 
- Did the qigong under inside the LBRP.
- Did actually take a longer walk. 

Things sorta turned around in the day, but there was alot of issues that had nothing to do with me.   I had a couple days where I did not have to spend every minute studying for class.  

Didn't have time to fill this out when I should have.
