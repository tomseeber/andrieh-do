## The Art of War
So I posted this on my facebook page yesterday:

>I match witchcraft of the mouth ( mostly false gossip intended to harm) with actual witchcraft, and I am pretty good at that actual magic stuff. Just be a better person, if you have a problem with me, let's talk over coffee or something. I am generally reasonable even if I am the wronged party, and pretty forgiving. This is true not just for me, we can make things better for each other by stopping others who are doing this and just telling them.. Knock it off.


Not a few hours letter I felt a little impotent annoyance.
After 3 independant readings, from people who did not know what really was going on ... all three strongly said the same thing, someone tried ( and failed to "curse" me).  I really expected it and was ready.

All I can say to that is 
	**Hahaahahahahhahaahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha**

Good luck, you'll need it.  Nice to be right about things.

Moving on.

## There is only Information
So this spellwork curse was an interesting effect.  It did not get through, but it did ping the shields.  Now at the time I got a little subconsiously confused.  I actually lost my balance a little because I lost track of which body it actually was going torwards.

This is good and bad.  It does mean that the Gigong and HGA work is working.  A clear seperation between the astral body and physical is useful in every day life, but it also impedes body alchemy.  Body as talisman right.   This implies my conceptualization is very good, but while most spiritual experts will tell you this is a great thing, and it is.... it does affect your ability to ignore negative ( to you), energies.   Integrating mind, body and spirit in this way is very much a great way to live, but... it negatively affects your ability to selectively pay attention to what you are doing.  That can increase with focus exercises, but it turns the spiritual world up as well as the body intuition.  These   on the surface is all good, until you have a deadline.

Western culture ( probably all culture but I will leave that alone) is really based on the denial of spiritual intution, and moreso compliance.   In more recent times, I think very few people are doing anything remotely close to what they would like to.  Jobs even connections to other people, interactions, etc... all lack substitive meaning.  Once you start doing these excercises, those tiny voices that say you should do something different... Well at least for me, they get louder.   Do the work more, the harder it is to ignore.    That brings other inner fears and demons up that you have to deal with.

If you ignore curse work that "sticks", or entropic elements around you, yes it tends to cause downward spirals that manifest in behavior and social realities first.   In this case, the interesting thing is that I physically lost balance... a hugely kinetic insight.   Now, I am dealing with Grieving, and shit so its not surprising. What is surprising is that it was crossed cued so far into body sensations, due to the gigong work .

##  Actually did Talisman work
I opted out of the Gigong work today, but did actual talisman work of a purification nature.   With some spell work coming up that way, I did some evocational work, to take care of the problem described above.  This will relate to Qigong, I promise.

So this evocation is with a set of powerful non-book spirits that could only be described as "alien", possibly cthulean ( but they aren't from that paradign).  They are really not intelligent and really are mission focused ( almost can do nothing but eat).  These spirits are also verbally un-named.   So what is outlined is a kinetic seal for the spirit.

Evocation was as per [my shapeshifting course](http://andriehvitimus.com/shapeshift), and Hands on Chaos Magic.  These are things I have a long term relationship with. 

Every spirit has a internal representation that arises from the interaction between you and it.  Some spirits will resist both a seal to call it, and a form in visual sense.  In fact, a spirit which resists conceptualization are far more difficult spirits to deal with.   That said, it is impossible to resist having at least a kinetic set of "effects".  Your body will react at least.  If it didn't, there really isnt even a real way that the spirit is interacting with you.  Your body most at least react in some way, as this is some sort of hook into the subconsious mind.  It is easy to ignore these reactions, but for these type of alien spirits, its critical.

Now Qigong actually teaches you in a classical sense, to actually pay real close attention to those body sensations, and then basically try to map out energy blocks and some body sensations to ill-adapted energy.  That is a gross high level overview.  If you are working in that way, it is not so hard to map up alien energies and then when you have a working map, summon something only with the set of "reactions".  As you move forward in working with an Alien spirit from the "outer" whatever, you just build a interface internally. We can call that a relationship, but with things that don't classically allow themselves to be anthropormized, relationship implies way too much humanity.  Interface is better.  

![Interface Process](/assets/images/interface.jpeg)

So you have kinda a process to interface building.

1. Body Reactions, possibly other sensations accross multiple sensory channells to a presense.  Write them down.

2. Banish each time.  Throughly.  Take accounting of your personality, and anything that happens.  This is risky magick.

3. Repeat sensations in meditation through submodality work, till you have "pressence" present.

4. Try to repeat these excercises until you can get some sort of real-world validation that the presense is not just a servitor or thoughtform.  That hardly matters, as a thoughtform can be quite effective... but if something is clearly not a thoughtform, and clearly alien in nature... EXTRA care needs to be taken, especially if it resisting changing its energy 

 **HINT:  you can usually change the sensory information a thoughtform produces in you, thus changing the thoughtform... it should change the thoughtform.   Spirits of note and alien, will resist this type of change.**
  
5. As you work through the interface with a spirit, you should increasingly build an understanding of it, and it should increasingly be able to get real world results on the point that the spirit can work on in this world.  That may be highly limited and specific, as alien shit does not really know about the human world much.

If this sounds like advanced Qigong, or even Taosist fuckery of a non-dogmatic sort, it is. Although this is not Taoist sorcery of the sort commercially sold and mass marketed.  Its in my shapeshifting course.

In this case particularly, the spirit was sent to clean up and just eat any negative spellwork lingering out there that just bounced off me, and continue to eat whatever it wants from there that is still tied to the negative spellwork at me.  So if a person is a sloppy magician throwing curses, well you can kinda get what this would do.  Oh did I menion, for the stalkers out there throwing down, the alien thing in this case does not particullar care what energy it eats, so a banishing ritual will just give it more "energy" thats connected to the original curse work once it locks in.   As I said. **hahahahah, Good luck**.

This spirit has been trained through the interface to actually only respond to talismans where the blood matches my blood, and only to where the blood on the talisman is the same as the person who is making the request.  Think of this as a double authentication key, mostly cause I dont want an alien intelligence of a entropic and alien sort, connected directly to my body Chi and thus mucking about about my subconsious mind.   Instead, I have to have a talisman with a double blood key and no other simulation of sympathetic links can work.   That's a relatively anal spiritually secure talisman link, beyond what is probably needed 99.9999% of the time.  I am just thorough.  

Now, almost immediately after sending the spirit with a second curse which will go unmentioned, I felt alot more clear headed about what to do where on social fronts.   The real reason this is all confusing, is simply there is alot of [dead tissue to clear](http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/04/december-talismans-day-2.html) out from these fronts. I have trained this alien intelligence to also via the methods above, to carry other curses while its feeding. 

Now just because I have a interface with these kinds of monsters.  I still sat down, banished, and did a full 30 minutes of Object concetration and meditation to freaking insure my subconsious mind was cleared out.
