Post the challenge, I took a day off was a no-mag.

There are several things I took away from this challenge.  

# One
I have to admit I am way overburdened, so much so that there was more then a few warning signals even with what was going on in the house before the death of my mentor and other deaths.   Death is never going to be easy, but I was at best tolerating stuff.

# Second
Heavy clearing work as much as I did, generates resentment which also has to be cleared.  I am doing alot more of the housework now, and using that as a meditation, see 4th way stuff.  

# Third
Things are not bothering me nearly as much which is huge progress, but I there are still attempts to violate boundaries.  Just a lot less and more manageable.  This tells me that like going down to point 4, I still have some issues on this point to correct.  

# Four
Conceptualizing the overwhelming external anxiety as an external entity and throwing down as if it was a real spiritual attack did work, but clearly I haven't won yet.  Its probably not possible to win actually.  Probably at best you can do is one step in front of the other.

# Five
I let alot of things slide to do the cleansing work and have been in this under-seige mindset.  I went from grieving to intense cleaning.  Given point 4, not sure I can really work on more aspirational goals but I can take one day at a time.

# Six
I probably have to admit, I don't really like teaching computer science or more correctly, I dont want to spend all my time preparing and the curriculum is WAY WAY limited.  I am going to try to apply for side hustles at real colleges thinking that might be the ticket actually instead of the boot camp model, which I don't really like and does not really give me much flexibility at all.

# Seven
A big part of the pain point I was meditating on was the social bullshit I had to deal with.  I have been working on my MBA so I let a lot of things go in the public author thing.  People I thought I was cool with, well I got thrown away as garbage.  Actually it kinda hurt my feelings. 
I will be correcting this with both magic and content production, and I will be following my more "Chicago" Rules, as I mean No Quarter will be given and back to pretty aggressive magic for the witch craft of the mouth. Literally, looking back at the reading for a year, I totally thought this SHOULD be the course of action.  Magical Brass Knuckles and doing shit. I miss doing public rituals in that I love the real artistry of it, but I don't miss conventions too much.  I do like smaller conventions, but I am just not a big partier or ass kisser, yep no.   The performance and the magick.. that that I love much.  Now I just wish I could get a few hundred dollars for costuming and props for each ritual so I could make them SUPER awesome pretty.


# Current projects and Aspirations
1.  Back to real body alchemy work, despite the time fuckery I put myself into.
    -  Well, I got my Gym membership back. 
    -  Gonna try to get up at but fuck early, and go work out in the morning, we will see about that.
    -  Got an armband thing for my phone, so I could do tai chi, serious walking, indoor biking.
    -  Going to seriously be anal about my fitness pal and journaling this.
2.  I am not sleeping like I should.  
    - It does not fell like this is anxiety, just like frustration that I couldn't actually get a real vacation cause of the amount of cleansing work I did. 
    - I really do not like mornings naturally at all, but I could do some solar sun rise shit that maybe will make it more interesting.
3.  I am going to reclaim a working office/working space, but I would love to recreate what I call my dark temple don't know how to do that one with the space, but I have some ideas.  I have the space have to con people into helping me move... I predict that will happen in may... yep that busy.
4.
