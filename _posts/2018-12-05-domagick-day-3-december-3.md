## Fed the spirits and did the work.
Well I fed the spirits, did the Gigong, meditated.
Was very very tired today... and its still 1 when I am starting.

Probably not the most exciting magic, but alas at least I am trying.   I have been thinking I need to do alot more talismans to destroy... or linking items and embuing those items to clear things out.   I will add more later.

I did not fix the programming issues, so this is still broke ( at least in part )....   Keep on keeping on.
