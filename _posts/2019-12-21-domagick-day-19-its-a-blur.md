So on day 18,   I did some Michael and Haniel work respectively  ( Venus and the Sun) to start refocusing and detailing, and turning things around.  So this was a continuation of the expression of conceptualizing some of the issues as external entities from [previous days](http://domagick.andriehvitimus.com/december-2018/2018/12/18/domagick-day-18-Every-Day-1-Step.html).   

I started by blessing some every day items, and doing some some Qigong to build energy before doing anything else.  Then rolled into the angel work on the points, carving out some 

Now, this combination definitely seemed to work although there was some push back it on some of this, but there was most certainly progress that was visual and tangible.   

Very much so, very much so.   Some reactions, some pushback, but tangible progress.   The Qigong, helps to ground and build earthy based Qi before doing the more cerebral energy work.

So this conception of some of the issues as a foreign malefic agent gives me some tools that are working to make progress.
